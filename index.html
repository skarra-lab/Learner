        <p class="description">There's one thing that seperates success from failure, <strong>Fear</strong>.<br>
            While the successful man was sweating up all night working his butt off taking chances everytime opportines rose
            the failure was fearing rejection scared of how people will think of him.<br>
            It's just a 4 words name but having an impact bigger than Superbowl's final match.<br>
            Man can even forget why he started his journey because he's scared, scared of people who busy minding
            their businesses. Fear plants illusions and doubts into man's head.<br>
            Making everything seem too big to be achieved or seem like it's for certain people.
