                            You Can't Always Get What You Want.<br>
                            Sometimes you <em>Hope</em> to achieve certain things<br>
                            but life turns out the least you expected.<br>
                            Now te best way to avoid depression and anxiety from<br>
                            this is accepting within yourself that we don't plan<br>
                            things we hope that they happen according to our<br>
                            desires but there is one person who decide if things<br>
                            do really happen, <strong>God</strong>.<br>
                            Things happen in God's way, you just need as a <br>
                            person to have more than 1 or 2 ideas/plans.<br>
                            Yes it is possible for both your plans to fail<br>
                            but the third one would only fail if you don't put<br>
                            enough effort.

                        Pace Yourself.<br>
                        Competition is another slow poison that people must<br>
                        try to avoid.
                        We often compete with people who are even too busy<br>
                        to be competing against us.<br>
                        As a person set your own pace(not influenced by someones<br>
                        progress) so you can make sure you execute all of your<br>
                        plan very well with no rush. Everything that's<br>
                        meant for you will always come to you rushing<br>
                        things isn't gonna help you with anything.
